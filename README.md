# Wall-Mounted-Tablet

I've always wanted a wall-mounted tablet to display key home informationâ€”weather, temperature, doors, windows, camera feeds, and more. I finally made it happen with a clean setup: a 14-inch tablet mounted magnetically, powered to stay between 50â€“80% charge to help prevent battery swelling.

I've recently shared my current dark-themed tablet dashboard layout. If you're interested, check it out here:

ðŸ’¬ Personal note: While this layout looks great, I donâ€™t recommend using this exact tablet for complex dashboards. Performance can be sluggish, especially with advanced cards, dynamic themes, and large automations.
If you're planning to run a more complex setup, invest in a higher-end tablet for a smoother experience.
